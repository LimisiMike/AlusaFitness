	1.	API Design

	•	Define and implement RESTful APIs for all core features:
	•	User Management: Register, login, and profile management.
	•	Client Management: CRUD operations for clients.
	•	Plan Management: CRUD operations for plans.
	•	Session Management: Scheduling and managing sessions.
	•	Progress Tracking: APIs for recording and retrieving progress data.
	•	Messaging: APIs for sending and receiving messages.

	2.	Database Schema
	•	Design the schema for users, clients, plans, sessions, and messages.
	•	Implement models and relationships in SQLAlchemy or another ORM.

	3.	Authentication

	•	Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
	•	Set up role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure proper access levels.

	4.	Integration
    
	•	Integrate with third-party services if needed (e.g., Stripe for payments).

	2.	Business Logic: Handle the logic for plan generation, session scheduling, and progress tracking.
	3.	Data Security: Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and properly protected.

4. Test the Application

**a. Frontend Testing

	1.	Unit Tests: Test individual components and pages.
	2.	Integration Tests: Test how components work together.
	3.	E2E Testing: Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the entire application works as expected.

**b. Backend Testing

	1.	Unit Tests: Test API endpoints and business logic.
	2.	Integration Tests: Verify that the backend interacts correctly with the database.
	3.	Performance Testing: Test the system’s performance under load.


5. Deployment

	1.	Dockerize the Application: Create Docker containers for both the frontend and backend.
	2.	Set Up Hosting: Use AWS EC2 or another cloud provider to host your application.
	3.	Configure CI/CD: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.
	4.	Monitor and Scale: Implement monitoring tools and set up auto-scaling if needed.
